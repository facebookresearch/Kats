## Description

Kats is a toolkit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, and generalizable framework to perform time series analysis. Time series analysis is an essential component of Data Science and Engineering work at industry, from understanding the key statistics and characteristics, detecting regressions and anomalies, to forecasting future trends. Kats aims to provide the one-stop shop for time series analysis, including detection, forecasting, feature extraction/embedding, multivariate analysis, etc.

Kats is released by Facebook's *Infrastructure Data Science* team. It is available for download on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kats/).

## Installation in Python

Kats is on PyPI, so you can use `pip` to install it.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install kats
```

If you need only a small subset of Kats, you can install a minimal version of Kats with
```bash
MINIMAL_KATS=1 pip install kats
```
which omits many dependencies (everything in `test_requirements.txt`).
However, this will disable many functionalities and cause `import kats` to log
warnings. See `setup.py` for full details and options.

## Examples

Here are a few sample snippets from a subset of Kats offerings:

### Forecasting

Using `Prophet` model to forecast the `air_passengers` data set.

```python
import pandas as pd

from kats.consts import TimeSeriesData
from kats.models.prophet import ProphetModel, ProphetParams

# take `air_passengers` data as an example
air_passengers_df = pd.read_csv(
    "../kats/data/air_passengers.csv",
    header=0,
    names=["time", "passengers"],
)

# convert to TimeSeriesData object
air_passengers_ts = TimeSeriesData(air_passengers_df)

# create a model param instance
params = ProphetParams(seasonality_mode='multiplicative') # additive mode gives worse results

# create a prophet model instance
m = ProphetModel(air_passengers_ts, params)

# fit model simply by calling m.fit()
m.fit()

# make prediction for next 30 month
fcst = m.predict(steps=30, freq="MS")
```

### Detection

Using `CUSUM` detection algorithm on simulated data set.

```python
# import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from kats.consts import TimeSeriesData
from kats.detectors.cusum_detection import CUSUMDetector

# simulate time series with increase
np.random.seed(10)
df_increase = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        'time': pd.date_range('2019-01-01', '2019-03-01'),
        'increase':np.concatenate([np.random.normal(1,0.2,30), np.random.normal(2,0.2,30)]),
    }
)

# convert to TimeSeriesData object
timeseries = TimeSeriesData(df_increase)

# run detector and find change points
change_points = CUSUMDetector(timeseries).detector()
```

### TSFeatures

We can extract meaningful features from the given time series data

```python
# Initiate feature extraction class
import pandas as pd
from kats.consts import TimeSeriesData
from kats.tsfeatures.tsfeatures import TsFeatures

# take `air_passengers` data as an example
air_passengers_df = pd.read_csv(
    "../kats/data/air_passengers.csv",
    header=0,
    names=["time", "passengers"],
)

# convert to TimeSeriesData object
air_passengers_ts = TimeSeriesData(air_passengers_df)

# calculate the TsFeatures
features = TsFeatures().transform(air_passengers_ts)
```
