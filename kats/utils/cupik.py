    CuPiK (Customized Pipeline for Kats) is created with a similar mindset
    of sklearn pipeline. Users can call multiple methods within Kats library
    and run them in sequential to perform a series of useful timeseries processes
    at once.

    Due to the current distribution of Kats library, we provide the function to
    apply detectors, transformers and time series modeling sequentially using CuPiK.
    We also offer api to sklearn, once feature extraction using TsFeatures is performed,
    users can feed the results directly to an sklearn machine learning model.
