"""This module is for seasonality detection.

We provide two seasonality detector: ACFDetector and FFTDetector. ACFDetector uses
autocorrelation function to find seasonality, while FFTDetector uses Fast Fourier
Transform to detect seasonality.

    Typical usage example:

    timeseries = TimeSeriesData(...)

    # initialize detector
    detector = ACFDetector(timeseries)
    # run detector
    detector.detector(diff=1, alpha = 0.01)
    # seasonality decomposition, returns trend, seasonal, residual term
    detector.remover()
    # plot acf and decompsition results
    detector.plot()
