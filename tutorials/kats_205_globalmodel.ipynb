    "## 1. Overview of global model for forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Global model (GM) is a powerful forecasting model based on neural networks, which is first proposed by Slawek Smyl and is the winning model of the M4 Forecasting competition (2018) and the Computational Intelligence in Forecasting International Time Series Competition (2016) (reference of the original model: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301153). Unlike traditional forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet), GM is trained with a large amount of time series and can be used for forecasting any new unseen time series of the same time granularity. Its award winning performance verifies that GM is of high accuracy. Moreover, GM is generic for batch processing (i.e., generating forecasts for several time series at the same time) and enjoys suprior efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Kats, we build upon the original model and provide two types of GMs: RNN-GM (for short-term forecasting) and S2S-GM (for mid-term/long-term forecasting).\n"
